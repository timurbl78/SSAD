# Quote-Getter

## 👋 About this project
This is a project we created as a template for showing and hiding quotes on any web-site.

## 🤔 Why do I need it?
If one needs to include show/hide some quote, some text in their web app, it is an implementation of the feature.
Adapt the code to your needs and use it.

In order to use the project, one needs only a web-browser on their local machine.
1) In order to install the project, one needs to go to the web-page of the project, click on green 'Code' button and choose 'Download ZIP' option.
2) The next step is to open downloaded archive, extract files from it to any directory.
3) To run the program, go to the directory with extracted files, double click on the 'index.html' file.
